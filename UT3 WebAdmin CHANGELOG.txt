v1.17 - 2009-09-?? (requires UT3 2.1)
-------------------------------------
- fixes the issue where changes to game profile disappeared when a new map
  was loaded.
- made some changes to the way the menu permissions are validated, the
  urls used for AJAX requests are now dependent to their base url. This
  addresses issues #74, #75

v1.16 - 2009-07-30 (requires UT3 2.1)
-------------------------------------
- added a warning when the localization file is corrupt. This causes missing
  menus.
- changed the method of detecting active mutators
- added functionality to configure server actors

v1.15 - 2009-05-17 (requires UT3 2.1)
-------------------------------------
- fixed a few typos
- added a setting to validate the IP in sessions. This increases security by 
  making sessions less prone to hijacking.
- added a basic translit system which allows conversion for certain information.
  this can be used to convert Cyrillic characters to their ASCII equivalent.
  This translit system is also used by the chatlog. See the file
  Localization/RUS/WebAdmin.rus how you should build your translit table.
  The translit system is needed because the webadmin can only produce ASCII (or 
  UTF-8) output. Internally UE3 uses UTF-16, which can not be used by the
  webadmin. 
  Note: The translit system is not used for input processing.
  Note: Because the tanslit table is stored in a localization file you need to
  have the appropriate Language set in UTEngine.ini or you have to manually
  copy the table to WebAdmin.int
- made all text localized, people can now localize the WebAdmin if they feel
  like it. To localize the HTML files define the HTMLSubDirectory localized
  variable, and create the proper files in the Web/WebAdmin/??? directory.
  Note: the <!-- #include ... --> files are not transparently handled.
- Don't send gzip encoded files to Safari browsers, they lies about supporting
  gzip encoded files (or at least, for javascript)
- various browser tweaks

v1.14.0 - 2009-04-05 (for UT3 2.0)
v1.14.1 - 2009-04-05 (for UT3 2.1)
----------------------------------
- added support to dynamically add skins to the webadmin. To register a skin
  simply create an .ini file in the Config directory with the following content
    [SomeName WebAdminSkin]
    FriendlyName=My Own Skins
    CssFile=/images/myskin/main.css
- added option to /current/bots to add an arbitrary number of bots
- added a system settings page to change webadmin settins
- reduced loading of gametype classes to filter the mutator lists, this reduces
  loading of additional packages during the game (which clients would need to
  download). You can force rebuild of the caches by visiting this (hidden) page:
  http://<webadmin.ip>/ServerAdmin/system/allowancecache 
  http://<webadmin.ip>/ServerAdmin/system/settingscache
  (note: this is something you might want to do after installing new or 
  upgrading gametypes/mutators)
